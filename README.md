## Name
War Card Game

## Description
A text-based recreation of the Card Game War in Java. Includes wars in the events of ties, as well as house rules like single-card gifts, and a turn counter that increases the amount of cards that trade hands as the game goes on.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Roadmap
Adding a GUI to this game instead of it just being text-based.
Possible online multiplayer component.

## Project status
Stopped for the time being.
